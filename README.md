# Project: Building with Responsive Design


## [Collaborative Project]

In these projects, youâ€™ll be working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.

## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- Add descriptive README file to your repositories.
- Use meaningful names for your Pull Requests and add a short summary of its content.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Do not commit files that are not related to the project. Instead, add them to [.gitignore file].
- Do not commit inline comments. They will make your project look messy. If you need to review a previous version of your code, you can always use git history.

### Project specific

- Use application layout for sign-in and sign-out links.
- In addition - make sure that users can also create their account by adding a Sign up feature.
- [HINT] as lesson about associations is still ahead of you - for setting up association between user and posts remember that User has many posts and Post belongs to user.
